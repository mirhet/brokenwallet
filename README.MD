# Broken wallet

Welcome to a broken wallet with a lot more to wish for. The question is where
to start ...

## Service
This service is a badly designed microservice that handles money-transactions in and out of an account. It uses HTTP RPC and a homebrewn version of CQRS (commands & queries). There's both a Java and Kotlin version available, and you can choose whichever you feel most comfortable with, just select the corresponding branch.

## Exercise
For this exercise, we want to "get in your mind" to get an understanding of how you approach problems. This service is similar to the ones we have in our platform, but very simplified. It builds, and runs, but it does however have some problems, and we ask you to try to spot these. There's a large variety in problems, ranging from very simple to more complex. 

The expectation for this exercise isn't that you need to find a certain number of problems, it's more for us to get an understanding of your attentiveness and problem solving skills. Topics to think about could be scalability, reliability, and performance, amongst others.

Checkout the java or kotlin branch based on your language preference.
